# Current state

Last updated: **2026-07-18**

## Status

The generic x402 Merchant cutover is complete on `main`.

Sompi is an API-first local purchasing runtime:

- `sompi-api` is the canonical Purchase interface;
- `sompi-agent` is the agent-facing CLI;
- `sompi-mcp` is an optional stateless compatibility wrapper;
- `sompi-authority` is the isolated human-present Authority;
- `sompi-operator` provisions policy, vault, chain evidence, and credentials.

Journal epoch 15 is the only active schema.

## Protocols

Payment is pinned to Kaspa-x402 `0.1.0-alpha.8` on TN10.

- `standard-native`: version 0, exact Merchant output.
- `additive`: version 1, reusable KIP-10-based head; successor delta is the
  entire Merchant payment.
- `batch-settlement`: capital-backed channel with separate approval for every
  charge increment.

The Merchant only needs to implement the supported x402 contract. Sompi sends
no proprietary Merchant authorization headers or receipt protocol.

Authorization is internal AP2-derived evidence signed by the Trusted Authority.
The exact AP2 v0.2 source/schema revision remains pinned as a provenance watch,
but Sompi makes no AP2 interoperability claim.

## Completed cutover

- Generic `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` evidence derives canonical Checkout Terms.
- Authorization binds the Merchant, request, payee, requirements, profile or
  channel, amount or ceiling, fees, finality, expiry, and Purchase.
- Merchant communication uses only the supported x402 contract; AP2-derived
  evidence remains internal to Sompi.
- Fulfilment is verified from the authorized request, paid response, settlement,
  and resource digest.
- Each completed Purchase records one canonical receipt.
- Standard-native, additive, and batch use the same authorization contract.
- API, CLI, skill, MCP, Telegram, policy denial, replay, restart, and ambiguous
  recovery paths are covered by tests.

## Fresh TN10 evidence

[`evidence/generic-x402-cutover/`](evidence/generic-x402-cutover/README.md)
records current-branch funded proofs:

- standard-native over the canonical HTTP API:
  `5699adb798f2535605d84391e611dd88dee9e49089b4b79f57744cfea19dfd13`;
- additive over MCP compatibility ingress:
  `efd2ab90eda9ff75ca0fd76487a95654e2dce2decceb544238f04df546c366f2`;
- batch claim:
  `18cd57a98a4bcf4ee21bf1d040cfdecf632f2d95127df97c63f4eadbe4fefc49`;
- strict-boundary batch refund:
  `107b8792cc302148476bba0fec3d1ed70fcea619694557a04a9370c0dfb5d1af`.

Both exact proofs show Merchant gain equal to the advertised 20,000,000 sompi.
The additive transaction has one output and mass 874 versus standard-native
mass 4,546 for these specific shapes. This is evidence for these transactions,
not a universal fee claim.

The public `demo.kaspa-x402.org` gateway was checked read-only and advertised
x402 v2 standard-native exact and batch settlement on a healthy TN10 chain.

## Terah

Terah remains the private operator-controlled Hermes deployment.

- Hermes is active.
- The installed Sompi skill and callback plugin match this repository.
- The current tarball installs and passes offline smoke on Terah's Node 24
  runtime without changing live services.
- The live services still run the earlier `0.8.0-69c8a64` build. This cutover
  has not been deployed there.

The earlier Phase 11 Telegram human-present and funded service evidence remains
valid for the unchanged Authority boundary. Fresh cutover exact proofs use the
isolated auto-approval fixture and do not claim a new human-present ceremony.

## Verification

At this state:

- 445 unit tests run: 444 pass and one root-only ownership test is skipped;
- the three Hermes plugin tests pass;
- local generic-Merchant E2E and crash recovery pass;
- x402 package/source/vector conformance passes;
- current and historical funded evidence locks pass;
- OpenAPI and Arazzo checks pass;
- production dependency audit reports zero vulnerabilities;
- the 192-file package policy, clean install, licence audit, and consumer smoke
  pass.

The project owner previously closed further formal security-scan iteration.
The existing audit record remains under [`security/audits/`](security/audits/).

## Remaining external actions

No push, npm publish, or Terah deployment was performed as part of this cutover.
Those are operator release actions.

Mainnet, autonomous authorization, passkeys, UCP, and official AP2/x402
interoperability remain out of scope. See
[`docs/mainnet-readiness.md`](docs/mainnet-readiness.md).
